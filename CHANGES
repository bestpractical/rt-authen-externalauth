0.08_01 2009-01-20 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - DoAuth method created to inherit the work that used to be performed by
   the Auth callback for autohandler.
 - GetAuth reduced to an interface. Its purpose is now just to check what
   type of service was passed and then call the GetAuth method from the
   right package.
 - Authentication now halts and returns with error if ExternalAuthPriority
   is not set. This prevents a fairly useless compile error and logs an
   explanation instead.
 - Information lookup is now bypassed and logged if ExternalInfoPriority is
   not set, preventing another useless compile error and replacing it with
   an explanation.
 - SSO Cookie authentication now available following the integration of
   RT::Authen::CookieAuth. Methods updated to reflect the availability of
   this service.
 - File added to house the cookie grab. While SSO cookies are a function of
   DBI authentication (at the moment at least) there is no need for DBI.pm
   to use CGI::Cookie for this one purpose. With the future possibility of
   futher cookie functions as well, I decided it deserved its own module.
 - Changed an unless($base) to unless(defined($base)) to allow for the use
   of a defined, but empty, baseDN so that an LDAP directory may be
   searched from the root.
 - CookieAuth settings have been merged into the ExternalAuth settings
   hash. Example from CookieAuth has been merged in.
 - 'auth' and 'info' settings have been deprecated and so have been removed
   from the examples. The function they served has been replaced by the
   ExternalAuthPriority and ExternalInfoPriority variables.
 - The override for the IsPassword method has been deprecated and deleted.
   It is no longer necessary to do password tests as a call to the User
   object. The equivalent function is now provided by GetAuth in
   ExternalAuth.pm and is called with an ExternalAuth service name,
   username and password. Currently, this only needs to be called by DoAuth
   in ExternalAuth.pm
 - While RT::Authen::ExternalAuth used to be used to integrate internal RT
   authentication with an external method as a single operation, this
   causes a lack of modularity. Now ExternalAuth is only concerned with its
   own authentication methods and if they fail then RT will decide to do
   fallback to internal authentication on its own.
 - Workaround for RT versions 3.8.0 and 3.8.1 removed.
   RT::Authen::ExternalAuth v0.08 will be officially compatible only with
   versions 3.8.2 and up.
 - README: Updated to include basic information on SSO cookies.
 - Makefile.PL: Updated to reflect the integration of
   RT::Authen::CookieAuth.

0.08 2009-01-24 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - Added ssl_version to example LDAP config as it is used by the code, but
   had not been demonstrated.
 - s/Crypt::MD5::md5_hex/Digest::MD5::md5_hex/ in example DBI config.
 - Added the ability to provide a static salt to the p_enc_sub however this
   behavious may be reviewed in future releases to allow integration with
   better encryption methods.
 - s/userSupportAccess/disabled/ in example DBI config.
 - Modified the log message regarding the RT-3.8.[01] plugin bug from error
   level to debug level and modified the text of the message to be more
   clear for RT-3.8.2+ users.

0.07_02 2008-12-22 Kevin Falcone <falcone@cpan.org>
 - Make the workaround needed for 3.8.1 work on 3.8.2

0.06_03 2008-10-31 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>, Kevin Falcone <falcone@cpan.org>
 - Add fix to work around a plugin bug in RT-3.8.0 & RT-3.8.1 preventing
   User_Vendor.pm overlay being required before RT::User is loaded.
 - Check the return value from calling RT::User::Create.
 - Check the return value when loading an autocreated user.
 - README: Updated to talk about removing old files in local/.
 - Added error-checking to complain if a an LDAP configuration is in use,
   but no d_filter has been specified.

0.06_02 2008-10-01 Kevin Falcone <falcone@cpan.org>
 - ChangeLog: Updates to previous release.

0.06_01 2008-10-17 Kevin Falcone <falcone@cpan.org>

 - Upgrade Module::Install::RTx to work better with RT-3.8.x

0.06 2008-11-01 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - A number of clarifications added to the example config comments such as
   making clear the fact that a valid d_filter is required.

0.05 2008-04-09 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - Typo on line 962 of User_Vendor.pm: s/servicen/service/
 - Deprecated $user_autocreated. It was being used to prevent a call to
   RT::User::UpdateFromExternal in User_Vendor.pm because it was deemed an
   unecessary expense to set the user's info and then look it up again
   straight after. However, I have since realised that UpdateFromExternal
   is the only code doing a check to see if the user has been disabled in
   the external source and so bypassing it when users are created allows
   new users to log in once even if they have not been "enabled". I will be
   doing a small rewrite of this code in the future to abstract the
   External disable-lookup code from UpdateFromExternal and perhaps remove
   the function altogether, but for now everything will work fine.

0.04 2008-04-03 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - The example LDAP ExternalSettings configuration did not contain example
   values for user and pass for RT's connection to an LDAP server. These
   have now been added. Thanks to Andrew Fay <andrew.fay@hotmail.com> for
   noticing this one.

0.03 2008-03-31 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - Bug found on lines 94-100 in Auth callback in autohandler.

   The ELSE block starting on line 95 was assigned to the IF starting
   on 85 instead of the IF block starting on line 86. This meant that
   if the user entered at the login screen exists no password would
   be checked.

   It was doing this:

   If session has current user who has an ID
       If password has already been validated
           SUCCESS
       Else
           Return to autohandler with valid session & implicit auth
   Else delete session

   This has now been corrected to this:

   If session has current user who has an ID
       If password has already been validated
           SUCCESS
       Else
           Delete session
   Else return to autohandler with whatever we had before the block

0.02 2008-03-17 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - Bug #1 found on line 446 of User_Vendor.pm; CanonicalizeUserInfo was
   being called directly, instead of being called on the $self user object.
   This was causing CanonicalizeUserInfo to shift the e-mail address it was
   passed into the $self var instead of the $email var. It was therefore
   returning a blank e-mail address regardless of the input.
 - User_Vendor.pm: Header comments altered to reflect that the file is part
   of the RT::Authen::ExternalAuth extension.

0.01 2008-03-13 Mike Peachey <zordrak@cpan.org>
 - Initial Release
