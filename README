RT-Authen-ExternalAuth

This module provides the ability to authenticate RT users
against one or more external data sources at once. It will
also allow information about that user to be loaded from
the same, or any other available, source.

The extension currently supports authentication and 
information from LDAP via the Net::LDAP module, and from
any data source that an installed DBI driver is available
for. 

It was originally designed and tested against: 

MySQL v4.1.21-standard
MySQL v5.0.22
Windows Active Directory v2003

But it has been designed so that it should work with ANY
LDAP service and ANY DBI-drivable database, based upon the
configuration given in your $RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

As of v0.08 ExternalAuth also allows you to pull a browser
cookie value and test it against a DBI data source allowing
the use of cookies for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.
This is due to the merging of RT::Authen::ExternalAuth and
RT::Authen::CookieAuth.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you are using RT 3.8.x, you need to enable this
module by adding RT::Authen::ExternalAuth to your
@Plugins configuration:

Set( @Plugins, qw(RT::Authen::ExternalAuth) );

Once installed, you should view the file:
    
3.4/3.6    $RTHOME/local/etc/ExternalAuth/RT_SiteConfig.pm
3.8        $RTHOME/local/plugins/RT-Auth-ExternalAuth/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Then use the examples provided to prepare your own custom 
configuration which should be added to your site configuration in
$RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Alternatively, you may alter the provided examples directly
and then include the extra directives by 'requiring' the
example file's path at the end of your RT_SiteConfig.pm


UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from 0.05 you may have some leftover
parts of the module in 

$RTHOME/local/lib/RT/User_Vendor.pm 
$RTHOME/local/lib/RT/Authen/External_Auth.pm

that will conflict with the new install and these should be removed
