=head1 NAME

RT::Authen::ExternalAuth - RT Authentication using External Sources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the ability to authenticate RT users against one or
more external data sources at once. It will also allow information about
that user to be loaded from the same, or any other available, source as
well as allowing multple redundant servers for each method.

The extension currently supports authentication and information from
LDAP via the Net::LDAP module, and from any data source that an
installed DBI driver is available for.

It is also possible to use cookies set by an alternate application for
Single Sign-On (SSO) with that application.  For example, you may
integrate RT with your own website login system so that once users log
in to your website, they will be automagically logged in to RT when they
access it.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

    Plugin('RT::Authen::ExternalAuth');

For RT 4.0, add this line:

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Authen::ExternalAuth) );

or add C<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth> to your existing C<@Plugins> line.

See L</CONFIGURATION> for additional configuration to add to your
F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file.

=head1 UPGRADING

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this extension, you must
remove the following files manually:

    /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Authen-ExternalAuth/lib/RT/User_Vendor.pm
    /opt/rt4/local/lib/RT/User_Vendor.pm
    /opt/rt4/local/lib/RT/Authen/External_Auth.pm

Otherwise you will most likely encounter an error about modifying a read
only value and be unable to start RT.

You may not have all of these files.  It depends what versions you are
upgrading between.

If you are using a vendor packaged RT, your local directories are likely
to be somewhere under /usr/local instead of in /opt/rt4 so you will need
to visit Configuration -> Tools -> System Configuration to find your
plugin root.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth> provides a lot of flexibility with many
configuration options.  The following desc these configuration options,
and provides a complete example.

=over 4

=item C<$ExternalAuthPriority>

The order in which the services defined in L</$ExternalSettings> should
be used to authenticate users.  Once the user has been authenticated by
one service, the rest are skipped.

You should remove services you don't use. For example, if you're only
using C<My_LDAP>, remove C<My_MySQL> and C<My_SSO_Cookie>.

    Set($ExternalAuthPriority,  [ 'My_LDAP',
                                  'My_MySQL',
                                  'My_SSO_Cookie'
                                ]
    );

=item C<$ExternalInfoPriority>

When multiple auth services are available, this value defines the order
in which the services defined in L</$ExternalSettings> should be used to
get information about users. This includes C<RealName>, telephone
numbers etc, but also whether or not the user should be considered
disabled.

Once a user record is found, no more services are checked.

You CANNOT use a SSO cookie to retrieve information.

You should remove services you don't use, but you must define
at least one service.

    Set($ExternalInfoPriority,  [ 'My_LDAP',
                                  'My_MySQL',
                                ]
    );

=item C<$AutoCreateNonExternalUsers>

If this is set to 1, then users should be autocreated by RT
as internal users if they fail to authenticate from an
external service. This is useful if you have users outside
your organization who might interface with RT, perhaps by sending
email to a support email address.

=item C<$ExternalSettings>

These are the full settings for each external service as a hash of
hashes.  Note that you may have as many external services as you wish.
They will be checked in the order specified in L</$ExternalAuthPriority>
and L</$ExternalInfoPriority> directives above.

The outer structure is a key with the authentication option (name of
external source). The value is a hash reference with configuration keys
and values, for example:

    Set($ExternalSettings, {
        My_LDAP => {
            type => 'ldap',
            ... other options ...
        },
        My_MySQL => {
            type => 'db',
            ... other options ...
        },
        ... other sources ...
    } );

As shown above, each description should have 'type' defined.
The following types are supported:

=over 4

=item ldap

Authenticate against and sync information with LDAP servers.  See
L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::LDAP> for details.

=item db

Authenticate against and sync information with external RDBMS, supported
by Perl's L<DBI> interface. See L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::DBI> for
details.

=item cookie

Authenticate by cookie. See L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::DBI::Cookie> for
details.

=back

See the modules noted above for configuration options specific to each
type.  The following apply to all types.

=over 4

=item attr_match_list

The list of RT attributes that uniquely identify a user. These values
are used, in order, to find users in the selected authentication
source. Each value specified here must have a mapping in the
L</attr_map> section below. You can remove values you don't expect to
match, but we recommend using C<Name> and C<EmailAddress> at a
minimum. For example:

    'attr_match_list' => [
        'Name',
        'EmailAddress',
    ],

You should not use items that can map to multiple users (such as a
C<RealName> or building name).

=item attr_map

Mapping of RT attributes on to attributes in the external source.
Valid keys are attributes of an
L<RT::User|http://bestpractical.com/rt/docs/latest/RT/User.html>.
The values are attributes from your authentication source.
For example, an LDAP mapping might look like:

    'attr_map' => {
        'Name'         => 'sAMAccountName',
        'EmailAddress' => 'mail',
        'Organization' => 'physicalDeliveryOfficeName',
        'RealName'     => 'cn',
        ...
    },

=head2 Example

    # Use the below LDAP source for both authentication, as well as user
    # information
    Set( $ExternalAuthPriority, ["My_LDAP"] );
    Set( $ExternalInfoPriority, ["My_LDAP"] );

    # Users created from LDAP should be Privileged; this is a core RT
    # option.  Additionally, this is the 4.2 name for the option; for RT
    # 4.0, is it named $AutoCreate   See the core RT documentation at
    # http://docs.bestpractical.com/RT_Config#UserAutocreateDefaultsOnLogin
    # for for further details.
    Set( $UserAutocreateDefaultsOnLogin, { Privileged => 1 } );

    # Users should still be autocreated by RT as internal users if they
    # fail to exist in an external service; this is so requestors (who
    # are not in LDAP) can still be created when they email in.
    Set($AutoCreateNonExternalUsers, 1);

    # Minimal LDAP configuration; see RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::LDAP for
    # further details and examples
    Set($ExternalSettings, {
        'My_LDAP'       =>  {
            'type'             =>  'ldap',
            'server'           =>  'ldap.example.com',
            # By not passing 'user' and 'pass' we are using an anonymous
            # bind, which some servers to not allow
            'base'             =>  'ou=Staff,dc=example,dc=com',
            'filter'           =>  '(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)',
            # Users are allowed to log in via email address or account
            # name
            'attr_match_list'  => [
                'Name',
                'EmailAddress',
            ],
            # Import the following properties of the user from LDAP upon
            # login
            'attr_map' => {
                'Name'         => 'sAMAccountName',
                'EmailAddress' => 'mail',
                'RealName'     => 'cn',
                'WorkPhone'    => 'telephoneNumber',
                'Address1'     => 'streetAddress',
                'City'         => 'l',
                'State'        => 'st',
                'Zip'          => 'postalCode',
                'Country'      => 'co',
            },
        },
